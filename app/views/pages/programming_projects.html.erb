                <li><b>Overview:</b> Android app that makes REST calls to a web API to get vocabulary terms and displays the words in a 'flashcards' format.</li>

            <p>As someone who loves studying languages AND programming, I thought I would try my hand at app development.  The app supports the three languages that I have studied over my life: Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.</p>
        </br>
            <p>There is a Spring Boot web API hosted on Heroku, with endpoints for getting different vocabulary terms, with the ability to filter on both category (verbs, adjectives, etc.) and level (scale 1-5). This API hooks into a small MySQL database I have hosted holding information on vocabulary terms and their associated metadata.</p>

                    <li>Heroku for hosting</li>

            <p>The project was a great introduction to me with several new technologies. Building a web API backed mobile app from the bottom-up was a great learning experience, and gave me an application that I use everyday for my language learning hobby.</p>
