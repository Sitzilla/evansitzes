            I am a graduate of the University of Arkansas currently working at a technology startup in Fayetteville Arkansas called Datarank.  Though I am young, I have a drive to learn and a constant goal to further educate myself.  Currently I am attempting to increase my knowledge of seoftware and coding skills through projects at work, as well as with several personal side projects. This first attempt at a website is to test some basic functionality, become familiar with the Rails framework, and serve as my introduction to the world!  My goal is to become an engineer who works every day to solve problems and build solutions, and to never stop learning new things.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a slew of interests that include reading good books, studying interesting subject matter, and meeting new people. Any questions or observations please feel free to send me a message at esitzes42@yahoo.com, or reach out via social media.
