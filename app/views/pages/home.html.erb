	        <p>
            I am a graduate of the University of Arkansas and work as a Software Engineer at a technology startup in Seattle, WA called Simply Measured.
            Though I am young, I have a drive to learn and a constant goal to further educate myself.  Currently I am attempting to increase my knowledge
            of software and coding skills through projects at work, as well as with several personal side projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to become an engineer who works every day to solve problems and build solutions, and to never stop learning new things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a slew of interests that include reading good books, studying interesting subject matter, and meeting new people. Feel free to send me a message at esitzes42@gmail.com, or to reach out via social media.
